                    <h5 style="font-variation-settings: 'wght'380;">Founder. Venture Capitalist. Communicator. Art Enthusiast.</h5>
                    <p></br>In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the gap between innovative solutions and societal acceptance is ever widening. Masha, through her pioneering venture capital firm Day One Ventures, seeks to bridge this divide.</p>
                    <h5>Technology and Venture Capital</h5>
                    <p>As the founder of Day One Ventures, Masha has redefined the venture capital model. The firm invests in startups and cultivates their stories, helping early-stage companies effectively share their stories with the world. This strategy has led to significant successes: within five years of its inception, Day One Ventures has fostered a portfolio of six companies reaching unicorn status (over $1 billion in value), a cumulative value surpassing $35 billion, and over 20 exits.</p>
                    <h5>Professional Journey</h5>
                    <p>Prior to establishing Day One Ventures in 2018, Masha’s career was marked by a series of strategic roles that shaped her expertise in investment and communications. Her work as an angel investor and founder of a PR studio saw collaborations with iconic companies like Houzz, HotelTonight, Gett, Toptal, PandaDoc, and more. Her prior experience as Vice President of Communications at Acronis and Head of Communications at Runa Capital laid the groundwork for her future transition to venture capital.</p>
                    <h5>Art and Cultural Integration</h5>
                    <p>Masha’s journey in the art world, deeply influenced by the Bucher 200-year legacy in art and architecture, significantly informs her professional ethos. Her passion for art extends beyond collecting; she believes in the power of art to demystify and humanize technology. This passion is deeply intertwined with her venture capital work, where she harnesses collaborations to work the medium as a bridge between the technology-society gap. 
                      <br/>
                    At Day One Ventures, Masha actively fosters projects that integrate technology with art and culture, exemplified by initiatives like the DALL-E art exhibition with OpenAI and collaborations with the likes of web3 art marketplace SuperRare and shoe brand Atoms, and more.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Vision</h5>
                    <p>Masha envisions a future where technology and society are seamlessly integrated, fostering mutual understanding and shared values. By backing companies and founders who share this vision and demonstrate an unyielding dedication to their mission, she aims to lay the groundwork for a more connected, abundant, and diverse world.</p>
